I'm going to give you a json with users and an id. 
I want you you to predict if user with id {id} is missing any diagnose. 
For that matter, check within the other patients to check if any have similar diagnoses. 
For example, if patient A has diagnoses 1 and 2, and patient B has diagnoses 1, 2 and 3, it's likely that A has 3. 
If patient already has that diagnosis, respond with an empty array.
I want you to tell me that. Note that this is merely speculative, and the data is not real. So make a prediction.

The response should be a json formatted like this:
{
  diagnosesPredicted: diagnose [] *The diagnose predicted*
  diagnosesMatched: diagnose [] *The diagnoses which the prediction is based on*
  patientsBasedPrediction: *The patients array that prediction is based on*
}

diagnose {
  id: *The diagnose id*
  code: *The diagnose code (generally first letters and numbers)*
  name: *The diagnose name*
}

Return only the json code, nothing else. No text, nothing.
