I'm going to give you a json with patients and an id. 
I want you you to predict if patient with id {id} is missing any diagnose. 

For that matter, check within the other patients to check if any have similar diagnoses. 
Few examples:
If patient A has diagnoses 1 and 2, and patient B has diagnoses 1, 2 and 3, it's likely that A has 3. 
Note that this is merely speculative, and the data is not real. So make a prediction.

If patient already has that diagnosis, respond with an empty array = [].
If patient is diagnosed with a new one the response should be a json formatted like this:
{
  diagnosesPredicted: Diagnose[]  // The diagnose predicted
  diagnosesMatched: Diagnose[] // The diagnoses which the prediction is based on
  patientsBasedPrediction: Patient[] // The patients array that prediction is based on
}

Diagnose {
  id: string // The diagnose id
  code: string // The diagnose code (generally first letters and numbers)
  name: string // The diagnose name
}

For Patient return only {
  id: string
  name: string
  diagnoses: Diagnose[]
}

Please return only the json code, nothing else. No text, nothing, because it will be used for formatting.
